This is a project I worked on at end of primary school and in high school.
Sharing mostly out of nostalgia. Original description:

The program was written to create catalouge of CDs in form of text files.

The program requires Windows 9x / ME / NT / 2000 / XP, although the database format is such that files are easily readable under all possible systems.

The program requires the inventory database to be in the SPIS sub-directory of the program's working directory.

To search for the data you are interested in, select the relevant categories and enter the text contained in the name of the item you are looking for. The search will start when the text cursor is positioned on the text field when ENTER is pressed.

Database Format:

The database consists of text files (TXT extension) whose names correspond to the numbers of subsequent discs.

THE PROGRAM IDENTIFIES THE DISCS BY THEIR NUMBERS AND THIS CANNOT BE CHANGED, THE PROGRAM WILL NOT SUPPORT OTHER NAMES THAN FOUR-CHARACTERS WHERE THE CHARS ARE DIGITS.

It is also worth knowing that the program determines the number of discs by checking the existence of files with consecutive numbers in names.
So if you delete, for example, the file 0010.TXT, even though there may be many discs in the list, the program will notice only 9.

File 0000.TXT lists the category names, which you can then use in the database files.

I do not make any in-depth manual because I wrote the program for my own use, but I do not forbid anyone to use the program for their own purposes.
I am happy to hear any comments on the program, if I have time.
